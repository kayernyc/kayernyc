### Hello! Bonjour ! Hallo! $Hello World

I'm a software engineer working in and around New York and I'm interested in languages, such as French and German but also 漢字 (the written form).

As a professional, my most recent work has been as an engineering manager, and in addition to building stuff, I love building happy, playful teams.
